                <h1>Trick or Treat - A Tale of Two Cousins</h1>
                <p><img src="images/ghost.png">"That vase just moved!"</p>
                <p>"Don't be silly" said Olive. "You just imagined it."</p>
                <p>"No I didn't" said Miles. "It definitely moved, all by itself."</p>
                <p>Olive was just about to tell him he was being silly when the lights flickered. "Just the wind blowing some electricity cables" she said to her cousin. She was visiting, just for the night while her Mum and Dad were going out. It was a big, old house at the end of a long drive, with just woods and fields around it. They had pulled the heavy curtains over the window to keep out the blackness of the night and to soften the sound of the wind howling through the trees. They looked at each other with eyes wide open.</p>
                <p>Then the lights went out!</p>
                <p>Olive screamed and they both jumped up. Miles yelped as he hit his shin on a low table and knocked a Lego model on to the wooden floor with a clatter. In the darkness they touched and then hugged each other for safety, straining to see in the darkness and listening for any sounds.</p>
                <p>Click, and the lights came on. "Sorry, I pushed the wrong switch," said Autumn, Miles' younger sister. Olive and Miles let go of each other and Miles said "You're supposed to be in bed, what do you think you are doing?" "I couldn't sleep," said Autumn, "and I thought I heard someone walking around upstairs. So I got up to investigate."</p>
                <p>"And did you find anyone," said Miles. "Or thing," added Olive.</p>
                <p>"No" replied Autumn, "but there was a funny smell on the landing, a sort of burnt toast smell and it was very chilly." "That's because you've just got out of bed" said Olive. "You were probably dreaming."</p>
                <p>Autumn put her hands on her hips and was about to explain that she was wide awake when there was a heavy knock on the front door. Then another. And a third. They all froze. Olive and Miles hugged each other again and Autumn joined them. "Who could that be at this time of night?" said Miles in a whisper. "Should we open the door?" Olive nodded. She moved behind Miles and pushed him hesitantly towards the door before he could complain. Autumn fell in behind, holding on to Olive's waist.</p>
                <p>They reached the front door and just as Mile's hand reached out for the catch there was another heavy knock, then another and a third. They all jumped backward and Autumn gave out a muffled squeal. "You stepped on my toes" she said in a pained whisper. Miles reached for the catch again and gingerly opened the door just a crack. He couldn't see anyone so he opened the door a little more and peered into the blackness, with Olive looking over his shoulder and Autumn trying to see around Olive's waist. But there was no one there. As their eyes became accustomed to the dark all they could see from the light seeping through from the sitting room was the bare gravel drive.</p>
                <p>Then they all nearly jumped out of their skins as a figure covered in black with yellow and orange flames and a white face with black sunken eyes shot into view from each side of the door.</p>
                <p>"Trick or treat!"</p>
